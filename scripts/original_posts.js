          "html": "<p>Johnny Miller is saying his farewells as a TV announcer, and to be sure, he has never been at a loss for words. The voice of golf at NBC for almost 30 years, Miller will make his final call Feb. 2 at Scottsdale, and he’ll be missed. As a longtime contributor to Golf World and Golf Digest, Miller provided candid and provocative commentary, perhaps never more so than in these excerpts. Over the years, he opened up about the toll of tour golf and offered insights into his approach to announcing. Miller has never been afraid to praise himself, but he’s also brutally forthright about shortcomings in himself and others. “Honesty and truth,” he says, “will always prevail.” —Mike O’Malley</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I WON THE BRITISH OPEN by six strokes, won at Phoenix by 14, won at Tucson by nine, and won other tournaments by eight, seven, six and five. I wasn’t winning tournaments by accident. This was going out and saying to the guys, This thing is history early.</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>SOME OF THE GUYS almost took it as an affront, like a basketball team that lost by 40 points: Why are you making us look bad?</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>MY THEORY IN GOLF was that when you’re on, keep it on, because you never know what tomorrow will bring.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I WASN'T CONSISTENT. I want to point that out. I was not a guy you could bank on every week. But when I was on and playing my best, I might have played as good golf as most anybody. I don’t want to be the one to say it, but some of my golf at the time was pretty unusual. Let’s leave it at that.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>IN MANY WAYS, I'M A SOFTY. I’m pretty street smart, growing up in San Francisco. I’m not a nerd, but I am sort of an easy-going guy. But I’m also sort of a semi-confrontational person. I don’t like getting in arguments with people—I like to peace-make—but I can get in there and mix it up if I need to. I just prefer not to.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I WAS NEVER a phenomenal putter. I was a very good putter from about 12 feet in, but I was always mediocre from outside 15 feet. My 61s and 62s, if you analyze them, were not rounds where I was chipping in and making 60-footers. It was a very methodical kind of 61. It was like, “That’s what he should have shot.”</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>LATER ON my putting short-circuited everything. My most extreme case of choking, in case you missed it, was against Jack Nicklaus in a “Shell’s Wonderful World of Golf” match in 1997. I’d looked forward to playing the match for a long time because it was at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, and I was playing against my hero. But I happened to have the worst putting day of my life. I three-putted so many times—seven in all—that when the show was edited for TV, they mercifully eliminated five of them. It was worse than embarrassing. From tee to green, I played as well as Jack, but on the greens it was like I was holding a snake in my hands. I couldn’t make a three-footer. There is no worse feeling than standing over a short putt, knowing you’ve got no chance to make it.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:1257,width:800/4JuOYRrcTNmNt2ZuA776\" alt=\"Miller at Royal Lytham in 1974, one of his five consecutive top-10 finishes in the Open Championship.\" title=\"GD020119_FEAT_MILLER_1.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"1257px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Photo by Walter Iooss Jr.</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Miller at Royal Lytham in 1974, one of his five consecutive top-10 finishes in the Open Championship.</p></div><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>WHEN I WAS IN MY PRIME, I had three distinct swing images. I had Lee Trevino, where I opened my left foot and took it back and leaned into my left foot and hit this low little squeeze/fade. I had Tony Lema, where I took it outside, sort of like Hubert Green with a light grip and dropped it in and hooked the ball high. And I had Johnny Miller, who hit the ball pretty straight. So no matter what pin or what hole it was, one of those three guys had the perfect shot for that hole. I even talked to Trevino before I hit it: C’mon, Lee, this is your shot.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I HIT THE BALL with almost a jai-alai type swing. I would gather the club toward the ball at impact in a very slow motion. Then with a snap of my legs and an explosion, I would almost gather the ball up and throw it at the target. It produced a shot that just floated up there like a knuckle ball; it came down very dead and very soft.</p><p></p><blockquote>“Your dreams probably say a lot about why you’re doing things.”</blockquote><p></p><p>WHAT WENT ON IN MY HEAD while I was playing was this: Would you please hurry up and hit, because I can’t wait to hit this shot. It’s going to be great. It’s going to be fun. I just couldn’t wait to knock the stinkin’ pin down.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I WAS ALWAYS in a tremendous rush in those days to do my thing. If I went fishing, I had to get there as quick as I could. I had to maximize every minute. There was no feeling that there was plenty of time—just relax and enjoy it. I don’t know if it was good or bad. Today, it would probably give me an ulcer. Now I don’t really worry about things. Today I’m the world’s greatest sleeper, if nothing else.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I ALWAYS DREAMED positive things. I always wanted to play the last hole either one-armed or left-handed. Or knock it up about a foot from the last hole with about a five-shot lead and just take my 3-wood out and blaze it out-of-bounds over the gallery’s head, then drop a ball back by the hole, tap in, and still win.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I HAD A PERIOD where I could be leading but sleep like I wasn’t even playing a tournament—no nerves. Golf was sort of fun. But after that, it got harder.</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>BEFORE, I WAS DREAMING about golf all the time, almost every night. My dreams about golf totally ended about 1976. Your dreams probably say a lot about why you’re doing things.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>IF YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE a negative to Johnny Miller, it would be that I didn’t relish having the last shot at the end of the game. That was not my thing. It was Jack Nicklaus’ thing. I’m not so sure that it was even Trevino’s. I think Tom Watson enjoyed it. Nicklaus wanted to be one shot back in the last round. I wanted to be eight shots ahead.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>JACK MADE ME LOOK like a hack in the majors. He had a very calculating, conservative and, for me, too-boring style of play. I’m just not willing to play that kind of golf; I get off on flooring it. For me to stay in traffic for three-fourths of the trip and then in the last quarter hope that people break down—then you step on the pedal just a touch, and that’s what wins you the tournaments—that wasn’t my brand of doing things in life.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I DIDN’T VALUE ENOUGH what it was to be a champion. I didn’t buy into the majors as much as I should have. … I think some of that was because I grew up caring more about Snead’s record for career victories than how many majors somebody had won. But when I started winning, Jack had sort of reversed the priority, and I never adjusted.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>PLAYERS WHO WIN a bunch of majors are special creatures. It’s not normal. Under heavy pressure, their brains are able to still process information smoothly. But if it’s not in your DNA, I don’t think you can really learn it.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>PRESSURE? The U.S. Open has longer lines at the bathroom than any tournament.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>MY ONLY REGRET— a little bit—was not winning the Masters. [Miller was second three times.] Only because it would be cool to go to that Champions Dinner.</p><p></p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:619,width:800/Zf5EkrAtQWStcwORGmzj\" alt=\"A dejected Miller after the end of the 1975 Masters, one of his three runner-up finishes at Augusta.\" title=\"johnny-miller-weiskopf-nicklaus-1975-masters-green-jacket-ceremony.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"619px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Bettmann</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>A dejected Miller after the end of the 1975 Masters, one of his three runner-up finishes at Augusta.</p></div><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I THINK ’74 AND ’75 took a pretty big piece out of me. After all the years Nicklaus had been in Arnold’s shadow, everybody had finally fallen in love with Jack. And as I was challenging Jack, a lot of people were like, “Don’t even think about comparing him to Nicklaus.” Like they were angry at me. I started feeling, Why bother if they aren’t going to accept me? I couldn’t really enjoy what I’d done, and I felt pressure to do more.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>JACK WAS ONE of the reasons I came out of my slump in the early ’80s. He said, “You don’t have to worry about John; he’ll be back.” And I was thinking, Gee, I didn’t know that. I thought I might be history. When he said that, it really helped.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>EVER SINCE I was a little boy, I never really played bad. I never had a downturn. Everything was always according to schedule. I had a foundation that could hold the world’s tallest building. That’s very important.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>MY FATHER INSTILLED IN ME tremendous things—positive thinking, always calling me Champ. He would say, “Hey, Champ, you’re going to make it.” I promise you that there has never been a father that helped his son and has been a better father/instructor to pave the way for a player to get on tour than my father. There is no way there has ever been a father to match him.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>MY DAD ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT self-esteem, how the psyche is so fragile, and how it gets attacked by the game. Everything with my dad was positive. He always found something good. The most powerful thing a son will ever hear is affirmation from his father.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>WHEN I WAS a Boy Scout, I learned that lesson of leaving your campsite better than you found it. I try to equate that to life, and I wish more people did. Sometimes I wonder how the world would be if there were a million Johnny Millers. I guess some would disagree, but I think it would be a better place.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>ONE OF THE COMMON TRAITS of great players is that everything has to be perfectly organized. I cannot stand looking at anything that isn’t orderly.</p><p></p><blockquote>“I had sort of done all the things I wanted to do in the game. I was just content. And when you’re content, you’re basically done.”</blockquote><p></p><p>I LIKED THE BOY SCOUTS, but I didn’t have time to become an Eagle Scout. My dad always said, “You have to be willing to do what your friends aren’t willing to do.” I was willing. When I was about 8, I had this feeling come over me like, You don’t have to worry; you’re going to be a champion golfer. And it never wavered. It was a march to whoever I was going to be. … The problems came once I got there.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>WE HAVE A SAYING in the [Mormon] church, “No amount of success in anything else can compensate for failure in the home.” In 1976, I was fighting with myself. I had the responsibility of the position I had in the game, plus having children in ’70, ’72, ’74, ’76, ’78 and ’80. I was thinking, I’m not failing in the home, but, obviously, to play at the level that I was expected to play would require tremendous sacrifices in the home and a lot of other areas. I was fighting the fact that I had sort of done all the things I wanted to do in the game. I was just content. And when you’re content, you’re basically done. I was happy. Everything was great. It was like, Well, that’s done. I climbed that mountain. Check out the view and enjoy it. Be a good dad and go fishing. I had lost that passionate love for the game. I really can honestly say that at that point, it became work for me.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>AS A TOUR PLAYER, by far the toughest moment was when I was packing my suitcase to head off to a tournament. My youngest son, Todd, was pulling at my pants leg, pleading, “Daddy, please don’t go! Can you stay so we can go fishing?” He followed me to the car, and to this day I can still see him in my rearview mirror, trotting after the car, reaching out with his hands, crying. The thought of that still makes me cry.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>LET'S FACE IT, professional golf and family don’t really mix very well. If you look at most of the Hall of Fame golfers, look at the family life—you can’t say it was red hot.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I WAS TRYING to be a man for all seasons. I loved the ranch work, loved my family, loved the church, loved fishing, loved my cars. I was trying to enjoy it all. And you know, the great golfers, they don’t have that sort of symphony of things going on.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I THINK most males around their early 30s will look at their career and say, Is this what I want to do the rest of my life? That question kept coming up in my early 30s: This is very exciting, but is this really what I want to do? And am I willing to sacrifice my time and keep leaving my family—all these little kids in diapers? Having children will take the fire out of anybody. And that weakened me in the golfing sense. I was home being a dad, and I was doing things that I wanted to do, but it was very hard for people with a worldly point of view to say, This career is sort of over. It was much harder for them than it was for me. I also knew deep down that financially I was in pretty good shape, and I didn’t really need the aggravation.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:2404,width:800/GvFhWQnETxqLK90rJ9Sb\" alt=\"Fishing with son John in California in 1974.\" title=\"GD020119_FEAT_MILLER_2.png\" width=\"800px\" height=\"2404px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Golf Digest Resource Center</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Fishing with son John in California in 1974.</p></div><p></p><p>I WASN'T SMART ENOUGH to know that buying that ranch in Napa and doing all the heavy work like the laborers and gaining 25 pounds would ruin my swing. … All of a sudden, I was built like a tight end. When I finally began to play again in 1977, it was like I was swinging the wrong end of the club, it felt so light. … That cut my career off by two or three years. When I went from 170 to 195 pounds and dropped back to 185, I was never the same. But the work on the ranch was maybe my way of saying, I’m checking out.</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>AS FAS AS HITTING IRONS CLOSE to the hole, you’d have to say Byron Nelson, and then you’d have to give me a look. For two or three years, I knew that every round I was going to hit two or three irons to kick-in distance. Bottom line—maybe not in a major—I know that if I played my best and Nicklaus played his best and Tiger played his best, I definitely could have hung with them.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>LISTEN TO YOUR SHOTS. In the winters when I was a kid, my dad had me practice in the basement of our house. I’d hit balls for hours into a canvas tarp tacked to the ceiling. Because I couldn’t see the ball flight, I relied on two kinds of feedback: how the shots felt and how they sounded. Thin shots, balls struck on the toe, and shots hit a shade fat have distinctive sounds. You’re always looking for that crisp thwack at impact. Even from the TV booth, I can usually tell immediately if an iron shot is mis-hit.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>TO BECOME A FIRST-RATE player, it’s simple: You must control distance with your irons. When I felt my iron game was at its peak, I’d sometimes ask my caddie for the distance to half a yard. You control distance by hitting the ball solidly and varying the length and speed of your swing. If you do that well, you become more precise, which rubs off on your direction, too. The week I won the 1974 Tucson Open, I hit the hole or the flagstick 10 times.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I CAN SEE WANTING 10 MORE yards with the driver, but squeezing extra distance out of your irons is the kiss of death. In my prime, my standard distance for the 9-iron was 125 yards. I hit my 6-iron 160 and my 4-iron 185. I didn’t want to be long with my irons, only smooth. Reining in my swing speed was key to distance control and accuracy. If you can resist the tendency to swing more than 75 percent, you’ll have better balance and rhythm. Your mechanics will be better, and you’ll find the sweet spot more often.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>WHINERS MAKE GOOD TV golf analysts. High-strung personalities seem to notice everything—course conditions, bad pairings, crowd noise, lousy breaks, crummy hole locations, you name it. As players, perhaps we observe too much, but on TV, that quality is a definite plus.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I FEEL MY FIRST responsibility is to the game of golf and to the viewers, and not so much to the tour players. In the past, the first responsibility of an announcer was to keep friendships he had on tour, and being nice so everybody would like him. I’m not doing it because I want to be different or because I want to be looked at as a great announcer. I’m doing it because I love to teach. I want people to leave the telecast saying, That was a great telecast. I learned something . . . and I got to get inside their heads. I can’t wait to tune in next week.</p><p></p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>AS A TV COMMENTATOR, ignoring the fact that athletes choke is disingenuous. Gagging under pressure is an issue with every person who plays the game, and it’s especially critical for professionals who have a lot at stake. The entire history of golf has been shaped by players who choked when it counted or got a handle on it and survived.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I CHOKED SO MANY TIMES over the years that it’s a joke. To me, it wasn’t the result of a character flaw. It wasn’t that I lacked courage. Choking isn’t like that at all. It’s merely stress manifesting itself mentally and physically.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I'VE NEVER BEEN unduly harsh, except for the time at the Ryder Cup when I suggested that Justin Leonard should have stayed home—a comment I later apologized for.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:1236,width:800/XxTwIgbJTNStEniJtVvZ\" alt=\"GettyImages-87920784.jpg\" title=\"GettyImages-87920784.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"1236px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Augusta National</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Miller long felt the pull of his family even when he was competing.</p></div><p></p><p>I JUST DIDN'T LIKE like the pressure, I guess. I didn’t really love putting my reputation on the line. … My biggest weakness was, I just didn’t love competition that much. I worked really hard to get to the top, but when I got there, I realized, Wow, there’s a lot of pressure.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>MY THEORY IN LIFE IS, honesty and truth will always prevail. Some people don’t like to hear the truth, but to me, that’s their problem. This job is bigger than me and my friends. That has not been the easiest thing for me. I could play it right down the middle as an announcer, not walk the edges of the rough like I do. I’m just teetering on falling into water hazards all the time. It would be much easier for me to be Mr. Nice Guy and just sort of do a nice fairy-tale walk through TV land, but I’ve always been one to notice little things, little flaws or little boo-boos.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>IF YOU LOOK AT MY CAREER when I was on, Nicklaus even said that’s the guy he wasn’t sure he could beat. Sometimes I think that when we get up in heaven, God’s going to let everyone be 28, and there’s going to be this great tournament. I think that would be a pretty cool thing.</p><p>● ● ●</p><p></p><p>I'VE HAD SOME TIMES when it looked like I was going to die in plane wrecks and everything else, and I felt very good about dying. That might sound dumb, but I felt very ready to die. I didn’t feel like it was bad to die. I just felt like it has been rather nice: Had a good time, not perfect, and I’ve done most things that I’ve wanted to do. If there were such a thing as a happiness meter, I’d match mine against any professional golfer who ever lived.</p>"

          "html": "<p>After an emotional farewell in early February at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Johnny Miller is back on the airwaves a little more than three months later.</p><p>However, before you carve out time this weekend expecting to see Miller back in the saddle as an analyst for golf telecasts, Miller’s “comeback” is a little more in line with someone who is retired. Callaway Golf announced on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with the hall of famer to be a brand ambassador for the company, a position which will include “a variety of content development projects, including the original podcast “Real Golf Talk with Johnny Miller.”</p><p>“I am proud to be returning to Callaway [Miller had been a Callaway staffer a number of years ago] and working with the company’s incredible team on some exciting new projects,” Miller said. “It feels like a homecoming for me, and I think golf fans will really enjoy what we have coming, starting with our new Real Golf Talk podcast.”</p><p>The podcast launches May 22 on iTunes and a variety of other platforms. Sitting alongside the two-time major champion will be Chris Harrison—an avid golfer best known for his host duties on ABC’s The Bachelor franchise—as the host.</p><p>“Johnny Miller was a legend on the course and in the TV booth there was no equal,\" Harrison said in a statement from Callaway. \"I know he’s got more to say on the world of golf and the world in general. There’s no chance I’m missing the opportunity to sit next to him.\"</p><p>Befitting a man of retirement age, the podcast won't be an arduous endeavor for Miller as it will feature just six episodes in 2019, which will air after major events on the golf calendar. The podcast will increase to eight episodes in future seasons.

          "html": "<p>It’s like my funeral going on,” Johnny Miller said—without choking, mind you—during a conference call Wednesday with the media discussing his impending farewell to his television career.</p><p>“Funeral of broadcasting,” chimed in his longtime 18th tower partner Dan Hicks.</p><p>Well, no one came to bury Miller. Or to praise him, really, though there was some of that on the call. It’s just that after nearly 30 years in the broadcast booth as the lead golf analyst for NBC Sports, a guy deserves a curtain call. And that’s what will occur during NBC’s third-round coverage of the Waste Management Phoenix Open on Saturday, Feb. 2, which happens to be Groundhog Day. Miller will not long leave his shadow on the network’s golf telecasts, as Paul Azinger slides into the chair the next afternoon for the final round from TPC Scottsdale.</p><p>It’s been a long goodbye of sorts, as Miller for the last few years has tried to untether himself from the NBC golf booth. But like Pacino in The Godfather III, every time he thought he was out, they would pull him back in.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>“I’ve given a lot of thought about this last event for me,” said Miller, 71, who joined NBC in 1990. “You know, I know it’s time. I could feel it was time to step down, but I stepped down a little early in my playing career and started announcing, and I think maybe I’ve done the same thing here with my announcing career. … I’m looking forward to trying to figure out what I’m going to do next after I retire. It’s like time goes on. There is a time and a season for everything. I’m looking forward to a really good attitude and a lot of gratefulness inside me for all the years of my playing career and announcing career.”</p><p>Miller, who had 35 professional wins, including the 1973 U.S. Open and the 1976 Open Championship, would have preferred to exit stage left at Pebble Beach, where he won the last of his 25 PGA Tour titles in 1994, but CBS owns the broadcast rights. Phoenix was the next best option, where he won back-to-back in 1974-’75 and earned the nickname the “Desert Fox” because of his success there and other arid climates out west.</p><p>With an ownership at Silverado Country Club in Napa, Calif., where the tour holds the season-opening Safeway Open, and golf schools at Silverado and Pebble Beach among other golf interests, Miller will continue to have his hand in the game. But after 50 years on the road since he turned pro in 1969, he no longer will have a voice in it.</p><p>His stoicism on golf broadcasts came through the telephone as he talked about his departure, but Hicks, also on the call, was a bit more emotional.</p><p>“I’m not going to lie. This is going to be tough for me,” said Hicks, who succeeded Dick Enberg as NBC’s golf anchor in 2000. “When you’ve got something going this good for all this time, you just want to keep it. You want to be a little selfish about it and just kind of keep it going and going and going because it’s such a great thing to hear him next to me and hear him describe the action, which has just I think changed the landscape of the whole business of golf broadcasting. No doubt about that.”</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:1233,width:1850/TL5y2imPTBqNtqMRU3yL\" alt=\"Johnny Miller, Dan Hicks\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-2018-tv-booth.jpg\" width=\"1850px\" height=\"1233px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Cy Cyr/PGA Tour</p></div><p></p><p>Miller did, literally, with a single one-syllable word: choke. That was as verboten from a broadcaster as the word shank is from a playing partner. Miller didn’t care, and he wasn’t trying to embarrass anyone. He just knew what a golfer might be feeling at times of high stress. Players bristled. Viewers brayed in appreciation.</p><p>“I think what people like … when you go to New York or Boston it’s always, Hey, Johnny, keep telling it like it is. That’s what every guy says. People are starving for the truth. A lot of people don’t want to go there. They don’t want to go for truthful things that maybe sound like they’re hurtful a little bit but they’re truths.</p><p>“I’m just being myself. I’m not trying to do anything. It’s just the way I view golf. I always say the pressure and the choke factor in golf are by far the most interesting part of golf. Greatest game in the world to basically choke on. It’s the greatest game.”</p><p>And, in truth, Miller knows he didn’t always get it right.</p><p>One of his favorite calls was during his first U.S. Open in 1995 at Shinnecock Hills, when Corey Pavin hit a fairway wood to within six feet of the cup on the 72nd hole. “He’s hit the shot of his life,” Miller exclaimed. For Hicks, he still marvels at the comment Miller offered at the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. “We weren’t even through the first round and Johnny said, ‘I just have this feeling that he’s going to do something special this week. He’s going to break all sorts of records. He’s going to have like a historical week.’ Then we all know what happened, a 15-shot victory.”</p><p>And on the other side, well, he’ll never get the 1999 Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., out of his head, when he said on Saturday that a struggling Justin Leonard should have stayed home. Leonard went on to clinch the U.S. comeback in singles the next day thanks to a 40-foot putt on the 17th green that set off an overzealous and controversial American celebration.</p><p>“That wasn’t too good,\" Miller said of the Leonard remark. \"There has been quite a few of them that probably I shouldn’t have said. Unfortunately, people love it. I don’t say it to make people love it. Just at that time, at the Ryder Cup I would get so darn mad because the U.S. just couldn’t win a Ryder Cup. Come on guys, you know? Sometimes like that my heart is in the right spot but the filter is not real … it’s pretty poor.”</p><p>“But I did try to apologize. My technique was if I said something like that I tried to apologize within 24 hours if I can. Like Craig Perry. I said that his swing would make Ben Hogan puke. That didn’t go over real big. Been a few things like that.”</p><p>Like the occasion early in his broadcast career when he opined that Leonard Thompson “looked like he has sort of a stick up his rear and doesn't have any rhythm in his swing,” Miller recalled. “He came up to me the next day. ‘I hear you don’t like my swing.’ Actually, I don’t. Sorry.”</p><p>But he didn’t have to apologize often. And he never had to apologize for being himself. It was the only way he knew how to do the job. His choice of words was almost always well chosen, even if it wasn’t well received in certain circles.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:1445,width:1850/aiZkZ4OxT5aanQaGsSMy\" alt=\"Johnny Miller\" title=\"johnny-miller-walking-course-nbc-2017.jpg\" width=\"1850px\" height=\"1445px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>David Cannon/Getty Images</p></div><p></p><p></p><p>The Hall for Famer ended Wednesday’s phone call with some well-chosen words that represented a last lament. And a hint at what is next.</p><p>“I think there is no real reason why I’m stepping down except for I just think I sort of like the round number of 50 years on the road. With all the responsibility of my big family and the grandkids, that was the main reason, is them. I’m jealous of my father, all the time that he spent with me and my game. Now with the grandkids, you know, time is the greatest gift you can give your kids. I’ve been pretty busy. It’s not like I did that many events every year, but just the body of work with my other involvements. We have a saying in our church that no amount of success can compensate for failure in the home. Not that I failed in the home, but I could have shot a little better score if I had been home more often.</p><p>“I think most men … they have to answer to that because life is very busy. It’s crazy busy actually. We just have to make time. I got this little window left, hopefully it’s 15 years or whatever it is, where I can impart some of the knowledge that I have and life skills and whatever to these grandkids that I have—and my own kids too for that matter. Also keep any marriage really strong, which it’s been.</p><p>“Probably more of an answer than you wanted,” he added, “but those are the kind of things that have been rattling around in my head.”</p><p>And for three decades he’s been sharing the things rattling in his head. What should not rattle around in there is the thought he won’t be missed.</p><p></p>"

          "html": "<p>Golfer Johnny Miller never played it safe.</p><p></p><p>During his Hall of Fame playing days, Miller took on every flagstick. When he stepped away from the PGA Tour, the quick-witted and cocksure Californian segued seamlessly to the television booth and took no prisoners during an award-winning second act.</p><p></p><p>Now at age 71, Miller will call it a career and turn his attention to his many other pursuits.</p><p></p><p>Miller owns several properties in northern California, has a foundation and golf school, is a father to six and a grandfather to 24. He even plans to dust off his golf clubs.</p><p></p><p>“It's been sort of a wild 50 years on the road,” Miller said. “I've been a busy guy in the game of golf. So I'll still try to see if I can get a little bit better at my golf. I've ignored it basically since I've been announcer. Like to play nine holes once in a while.</p><p></p><p>“I am definitely going to be busy. No doubt about it.”</p><p></p><p>Miller’s nearly 30-year run with NBC Sports will end Saturday, fittingly, during the third round of the Phoenix Open.</p><p></p><p>Miller earned his “Desert Fox” nickname for his unparalleled play in the Southwest, including a 14-stroke win in 1975 to defend his title in Phoenix. A week later, he defended his crown in Tucson with final-round 61 en route to a nine-shot victory.</p><p></p><p>The two-week stretch was vintage Miller.</p><p></p><p>Amid golf’s golden age in the 1970s, Miller pretty much originated the runaway victory and outrageously low round. Wearing plaid pants, a white belt and color patterns befitting a peacock, Miller also did it with panache.</p><p></p><p>Those wins in the desert highlighted a two-season hot streak the modern game had not produced prior to Tiger Woods’ arrival. In 1974 and 1975, Miller won a dozen times on Tour.</p><p></p><p>Miller sandwiched the amazing stretch with his two greatest wins. At the 1973 U.S. Open win at Oakmont, he edged local legend Arnold Palmer with a final-round 63 — still the gold standard for 18 holes. At the 1976 British Open at Royal Birkdale, Miller dusted 19-year-old Spanish sensation Seve Ballesteros.</p><p></p><p>Jack Nicklaus, Miller’s hero, even struggled to keep up when Miller was on his game.</p><p></p><p>“When I was at my peak,” Miller told Golf Magazine in 2010, “I would go into streaks where I felt that I could knock down the pin from anywhere with my irons. I played some golf that I think is unequaled.”</p><p></p><p>Yet, the 25-time winner wonders how many people remember his heyday as a player.</p><p></p><p>“Some people do,” Miller allowed last week. “That's a lot of years.”</p><p></p><p>Miller is being modest. He also makes a fair point.</p><p></p><p>Miller’s announcing career has come to define him while redefining a color analyst’s role and the relationship to his subjects.</p><p></p><p>Miller’s unvarnished honesty and perspective as one of the game’s all-time greats earned him eight Emmy awards for sports broadcasting. He also drew his share of detractors in a gentleman’s game where some things were best left unsaid.</p><p></p><p>Operating without a filter and with complete conviction, Miller said whatever came to mind.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, his zingers backfired.</p><p></p><p>When Rocco Mediate took Woods to a playoff at the 2008 U.S. Open, Miller said of Mediate, “He looks more like the guy who cleans Tiger’s swimming pool.” Meant as a nod to Rocco’s everyman bearing, Miller later apologized for the presumed insult.</p><p></p><p>On a particularly erratic ball-striking day for Phil Mickelson, Miller said, “If he couldn’t chip, he’d be selling cars in San Diego.” Mickelson’s short game surely is his genius, but the comment still did not sit well with Lefty.</p><p></p><p>The list goes on.</p><p></p><p>Miller’s approach did not earn him friends on the practice range but won him fans in living rooms across America.</p><p></p><p>“When you go to New York or Boston, it's always, ‘Hey, Johnny, keep telling it like it is,’” he said. “That's what every guy says.”</p><p></p><p>Before Miller came along, former athletes turned broadcasters went out of their way not to offend.</p><p></p><p>Miller set a new course.</p><p></p><p>While preparing a tribute to Miller that will be aired Saturday, Dan Hicks, NBC’s longtime golf play-by-play man, was reminded of his sidekick’s singular style.</p><p></p><p>Few broadcasters — John McEnroe and Charles Barkley are two — truly have carried the torch.</p><p></p><p>“Johnny always gives a different angle to it,” Hicks said. “I learned more and more about that when I was going through all these tapes and all the great calls he had. He did it several times a telecast. McEnroe is one guy, but I'll tell you what, it's a really short list.</p><p></p><p>“I can't really think of anybody that has rivaled him in the aspect of just giving you the unexpected stuff.”</p><p></p><p>Miller’s final call might be a little more predictable.</p><p></p><p>Back during Miller’s early days in the booth, he stunned the golf world when he suggested a struggling player was “choking.” Miller now looks to avoid getting choked up.</p><p></p><p>The idea of leaving behind the game after six decades is sobering, even someone never lacking for confidence. It also is time.</p><p></p><p>Miller wants his final day to like just another one telling it like it is in the booth, but he knows better.</p><p></p><p>“I'm looking forward to trying not to cry, basically,” he said.</p>"

          "html": "<p>Word back in October of Johnny Miller’s retirement summoned all kinds of obvious memories of his broadcasting perfection. The mélange of odd nomenclature such as “side-boards,” “fall lines,” “Campbell’s chunkys” and his trademark “yowza.” There was his willingness to use the word “choke,” though he very rarely did the last 15 years or so. There were his tears on Father’s Days at U.S. Opens, the reminders of his 1970s heyday when he lit up the desert and his unabashed fandom of “young guns.”</p><p>But his leaving brings back more curious and distant memories for me, starting in 1982 when Miller, still a ways away from becoming an analyst for NBC in 1989, had an early go at broadcasting on local TV in Utah. The gig was the Utah Open, played at Willow Creek Country Club. It was utterly a lark for Miller, a Brigham Young University grad who had a home in the area. He still was an active tour player but was on some sort of hiatus. It was a short broadcast, reminiscent of the first Masters broadcasts that featured only a couple of cameras. I met him on the practice green and was flattered when he explained the arm-bar putting method he was fooling around with. After playing in the pro-am (the pro-am team I was on tied his with a score of 20 under), he stepped into the booth and offered his frank assessments of local and regional club pros. Miller was a very rough diamond in tall rough. I recall him interrupting the host announcer a lot, and comparing good rounds to ones he’d shot. The Miller TV persona we saw at NBC existed in raw form, all kinds of potential nobody saw.</p><p>Personal exposure to a player of Miller’s repute makes an impression on a young person, and it got much better a few years later when I went to work for Golf Digest. Over the course of a 20-year period beginning in 1984, I ghosted most of his columns and all of instruction and year-end stories he did for us. I also helped him write his 2004 book entitled I Call the Shots. It was the coolest association ever, and he stands alone as the most interesting person to talk golf with I ever met. Jackie Burke, Lee Trevino and Jack Nicklaus are right there with him, but if you took those three away and left only Miller, I’d still have had a worthwhile career.</p><p>• • •</p><p>One of my early assignments was to cover a Spalding outing, in which the company was rolling out a two-piece golf ball it promised was light years better than its famous Top-Flite, which travelled for miles but didn’t spin much and felt like hard ceramic when you hit it. The Tour Edition was purported to have a soft feel that would spin nicely. It was ahead of its time in some ways, an early assault on the three-piece wound-construction ball that had dominated pro golf for decades.</p><p>To prove the Tour Edition’s bonafides, Spalding officials brought to the outing at Pelham Country Club outside New York City their three best staff players, Greg Norman, Craig Stadler and Miller. After a nice lunch and a verbal roll-out, they moved the proceedings to the course so the players could demonstrate. They spilled big baskets of Tour Editions in front of a crowd of about 50. It was announced that each player would in turn hit 25 balls, aiming at a green 155 yards away. Stadler went first and played “call shot” in impressive fashion, predicting how each ball would behave after hitting the green. All of the shots hit the green and a several stopped within six feet of the flagstick, provoking cheers from the audience.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:613,width:800/9vhY3jHqSHGFHKgjUWNd\" alt=\"Miller&#x27;s ball-striking was the envy of his generation.\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-driving.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"613px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>R&#x26;A Championships</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Miller's ball-striking was the envy of his generation.</p></div><p></p><p>Next up was Norman, dead in the prime of his career. This was 1986, the year of his “Saturday Slam” in which he led each of the four majors after three rounds but won only the British Open, at Turnberry. Norman was much more impressive than Stadler. The Shark hit towering fades, draws and straight shots with astonishing accuracy, the ball spinning wildly to the left, right or straight backward after landing, each one dancing exactly as he predicted. A few shots stopped within three feet of the hole. The onlookers were wild with their applause.</p><p>Last to hit was Miller. It took a while for the Spalding guys to find him, as he’d been chatting with someone in the crowd and blithely ignoring what Norman and Stadler were doing. The way he strode past Stadler and Norman, seated in their collapsible chairs, was memorable. He looked at them dismissively, if not downright arrogantly, walking that imperious walk of his, kicking his feet out in advance of each step, his legs straightening before they reached the ground. Miller always speculated that his walk—or strut—may have actually caused him knee problems.</p><p>Miller asked for the distance. The 155 yards had been announced but Johnny wasn’t paying attention because he didn’t really care—and with the 155-yard number known, proceeded to show Stadler, Norman and rest of us what serious ball-striking really was about. He hit low, crewcut-high screamers that made a divine noise you don’t hear in golf balls any more. He hit three low ones like that, each tearing out a deep chunk on the green and skidding to a halt inches from the hole. “I can hit it high with this Tour Edition, too,” he said, and hit a series of high floaters that didn’t spin at all but plopped dead next to the stick. Then he curved shots both ways, hit a couple of thin ones on purpose (they still braked to a halt) and hit some huge, looping, silly shots, ones he might play if he were bending them around a tree. He took almost no divot on any shot, shaving only the tops of the grass with unreal precision. He got sharper as he went along and the crowd, instead of cheering, fell mostly silent, mesmerized as he explained what he was doing.</p><p>Two of Miller’s shots hit the flagstick. Another lipped out. After one of the flagstick-rattlers, he turned to Stadler and Norman and said in that super-confident tone we eventually got used to hearing on TV, “How would you guys like to do this for money? Say, $50 a shot?” Their reaction was amazing. Stadler and Norman slunk back in their chairs, laughing nervously, kind of shying away. Years later Miller would tell me how the dominant animal in the jungle holds its head higher than the lesser ones. When it came to hitting irons, Miller was the dominant animal. Neither Norman nor Stadler wanted any part of him.</p><p>• • •</p><p>Over the years, when I met with Miller annually and approached the doors of his homes in Napa and Pebble Beach in California, or the one outside Park City, Utah, I knew two hours of surprises, wisdom, humor and hot takes awaited me inside. Good as he was on TV, he always was constrained to 3- or 10-second bursts, not enough to truly air things out. In person, Miller is one of the greatest story tellers who ever lived, his excellent memory combined with a varied lifetime in golf provoking Zelig-like stories that were incredible, at least to me. He always filled my notebook and tape recorder with observations, advice, reminiscences and predictions about the game and its players. He was always generous, professional, on time and determined to give me more than I needed.</p><p>Johnny typically answered the door wearing jeans, a golf shirt and loafers with no socks. Once inside, his wife, Linda, frequently made tuna sandwiches. He always asked about my family. There is great warmth in his home. All kinds of amazing golf bric-a-brac littered his houses. I’d pick up a driver resting in the corner and he’d say, “That’s the one Arnold Palmer used in the 1975 Ryder Cup.” Or, “That sand wedge you’re holding, that’s the one Billy Casper used when he won the 1966 U.S. Open at Olympic.” He’d waggle them while he dispensed hot takes, homespun advice and unusual views on everything.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:603,width:800/cGPWME75TC4JlVq3h6pr\" alt=\"Augusta National\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-wooden-driver.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"603px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Augusta National</p></div><p></p><p></p><p>His takes on junior golf come to mind. How do you get a small child hooked in golf? “Take him to a course with a pond and let him hit balls into the water,” he said. When I asked why, he said, “Because little kids love to see things splash and they will beg to come back,” he said. How do you teach them about golf course safety? “Call the kid over, show him the iron clubhead up close, then, without warning, give him a light tap on the forehead. It won’t hurt him, but the small amount of pain will shock them. For the rest of their lives, they will realize clubs can do a lot of damage.”</p><p>Still talking about junior golf, he told me how, at age 9, he’d won a local closest-to-the-hole contest in his hometown of San Francisco. After he was presented with a small trophy, a man with a goatee approached Miller’s father and pleaded to have young Johnny try one of his putters. Miller’s father agreed, and the man, who said he was an engineer for General Electric, piled the Millers into his tiny Citroen automobile and drove them to his home. There, in his garage, sat a slew of bizarre-looking putters in various stages of hand-made production. He handed Johnny a finished prototype, dropped a ball on a patch of carpet and invited him to hit. The noise it made at impact—a loud “ping,” was more than Miller’s protective father could stand. “Thank you very much,” said the elder Miller, “but I think Johnny will be sticking with his Bulls Eye.” The man, crestfallen, told them that his name was Karsten Solheim and that if they ever wanted to try one of the other models he had cooking, to give them him a call. “I’ve often wondered what that finished prototype—it was a Ping 1A—would be worth today had I held on to it,” said Johnny.</p><p>If the stories weren’t enough, there were the instances when I watched Miller hit balls, when he wasn’t too far past his prime. One year, for an instruction shoot in Palm Springs, Miller showed up without his clubs. He was with Callaway Golf then, and his contract stated that he use a Great Big Bertha driver. The shop was sold out, so the best we could do was borrow one from a member’s bag. The only member that had the Great Big Bertha was an older woman, and the shaft was like spaghetti. Miller hefted and hard-waggled the club, then proceeded to slice his first shot 60 yards into the side of a mountain. The next one he snap-hooked 40 yards the other way. “OK, I got it now,” he said, and signaled the photographer to start shooting. He pured the next 15 drives, and I mean throw-a-blanket-over-them close.</p><p>But back to Miller’s storytelling skills. As everyone who listened to Johnny on TV came to know, he is deeply spiritual with a somewhat mystical bent. We heard many times his stories about how he won the 1987 AT&#x26;T after a voice from nowhere told him to putt while looking at the hole, as well as the tale of his final-round 63 at the 1973 U.S Open, which happened when he heard the same voice tell him before the round to open his stance. A believer in destiny who trusted and acted upon existential prompts, a couple of things were out there. For example, he believes that trees “almost” have spirits and in his course design work, feels slight pangs of regret when trees need to be cut down. He is a great admirer of Native American people with a great respect for their spiritual traditions, one reason he quietly has conducted the Native American Johnny Miller Golf Tournament for more than 20 years at Snow Canyon in St. George, Utah.</p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:1294,width:800/S85GMFkbRS4T73odbXBm\" alt=\"Miller during his triumphant 63 to win the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont.\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-us-open-1973.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"1294px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Bettmann</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Miller during his triumphant 63 to win the 1973 U.S. Open at Oakmont.</p></div><p></p><p>• • •</p><p>Two stories he told me had strange personal consequences for me, enough to convince that Miller is, in fact, touched by something not of this earth. In January 1994, he invited me to his home in Napa, Calif., to let me interview him for an oral history of the 1975 Masters, the one he and Tom Weiskopf lost by a stroke to Jack Nicklaus. I brought along a VHS tape of the back nine to help jog Miller’s memory, and when the tape began playing, there quickly came a scene showing Johnny striding down the fairway with his traditional caddie, a thick-waisted Augusta National veteran of 30 years named Mark Eubanks. Miller grabbed the remote and paused the tape.</p><p>“Mark was a great caddie, knew everything about Augusta National,” he said. “He was good company and had the yardages down cold. The thing I remember most about Mark, whenever I got near the lead, he got nervous—very nervous. He would get so nervous he couldn’t speak clearly. All he could do was stammer.</p><p>“Mark also sweated profusely when we under pressure, but he perspired only through his hands,” Miller said. “It was amazing. Mark’s face and arms would be bone dry, but his hands literally dripped like a leaky faucet. On the back nine that day he completely soaked our towel with perspiration. It was like he’d submerged it in Rae’s Creek. The closer to the lead I got, the faster his hands dripped. I had to ask him not to touch my grips when he handed me a club, because he was drenching them and making them too slippery to hold.</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:603,width:800/mdbxQlNQQ2qehqHJQ1Rg\" alt=\"Eubanks was Miller&#x27;s man at the Masters.\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-masters-caddie.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"603px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Augusta National</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Eubanks was Miller's man at the Masters.</p></div><p></p><p>At the Masters a few months later, I managed to track down several more players and caddies, including Eubanks. I’d forgotten the sweaty-hands anecdote. When I asked him if he would be up for driving with me over to our company’s rental house to watch the tape and shake loose his memories, he agreed—if I paid him. I couldn’t do that, but I could offer all the beer and cigarettes he could consume. He agreed.</p><p>The rental house was more like a mansion, huge, richly furnished and in the best part of town. As I unpacked the beer, I noticed Eubanks wearing an expression of someone about to spend the night in a haunted house. It suddenly occurred to me that Eubanks, African-American and from the other side of town, may never had been inside a house like this one in his entire life. As I loaded the same VHS tape I’d been packing around, Eubanks opened a pack of cigarettes and nervously asked me if I would give him a light. I did, but a minute later he asked me to re-light his cigarette. Odd, because I don’t recall cigarettes extinguishing themselves. Two minutes later he asked to have it relit again, and when I looked over Eubanks’ hands were sweating profusely, the steady drip forming a small puddle on the hardwood floor. That Miller story! It was eerie.</p><p>Miller liked to tell the story of going up against Seve Ballesteros in a sudden-death playoff at the inaugural Million Dollar Challenge in South Africa in 1981. First prize was $500,000, a huge sum in those days. Miller, knowing that Seve was at the peak of his powers, understood heading to the first tee it would take something special to win. He said he recalled meeting early in the week a mystic and non-golfer named Rene Kurinsky. She had taken Miller aside and said, “You will win this week. I can see it. But you will win only if you do not under any circumstance wish badly for your opponent. When he has a putt to make, do not wish for his ball to stay out of the hole.” The mystic told Miller that the vibration he gives off will only empower the opponent. “All he feels is the raw energy of the vibration. Good or bad, he will feed off it. So don’t think anything.”</p><p></p><img src=\"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/resize=height:617,width:800/huzKEjSxTdO2kzZoDZ7t\" alt=\"Miller stands with a commemorative painting after he was named the 2014 Ambassador of Golf at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.\" title=\"johnny-miller-newsmakers-pga-tour-award.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"617px\" class=\"css-1pmpp80\"><div class=\"source\"><p>Chris Condon/PGA Tour</p></div><div class=\"caption\"><p>Miller stands with a commemorative painting after he was named the 2014 Ambassador of Golf at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.</p></div><p></p><p>Miller said that on at least five holes during the sudden-death playoff, Ballesteros had several short makeable putts to win. Miller, recalling the advice from Kurinsky, kept his mind blank when Ballesteros putted, refusing to do what we all do—think, Miss it, Noonan. The great Seve missed them all, and Miller won on the ninth extra hole of sudden death.</p><p>Some time later, I related Miller’s story to my regular partner in our club’s member-member. We both adopted the mind-blank attitude, and the number of times our opponent’s missing clutch putts down the stretch seemed to increase dramatically. Word of Miller’s tip spread, and within a year or two, half the players in the member-member were turning their backs when their opponents putted. Miller’s quirky tales had power and never seemed to end with his telling.</p><p>• • •</p><p>I’ll close with a story I rarely tell anymore because I tired of watching people rolling their eyes. Shortly after Sept. 11, I visited Miller at his Utah home. After our initial hellos, he asked, “Don’t you live near New York City?” I told him I lived 80 miles from there. After some big-brotherly reminding of how important our families are, he paused for minute with his eyes closed in a meditative way. He opened them and said gently, “If something like happens again, I think you should drive north.” I stammered, “What?” He said, “I see you driving upstate. It will be safer than driving south.” Something about it was not at all ridiculous.</p><p>When I got home, the first thing I did was get together some supplies and plot a non-congested route from Connecticut to Utica, N.Y. That’s what hanging around Johnny Miller for 15 years will do to you.</p>"
